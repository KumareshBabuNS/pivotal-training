= Lab 07c - Fault-Tolerance with Hystrix

Estimated time to complete: 20 minutes
[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
We'll again use Spring Cloud Netflix to implement client-side load balancing with Ribbon.
However, this time we'll add an implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern using Netflix Hystrix.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Refactor the consumer application from link:../../session_07/lab_07a/lab_07a_load_balancing.adoc[Lab 07a] to add a \ `ProducerClient`.
. Test the new consumer version against our local pool of producers
. Kill one of the producers and watch the consumer failover.
. Kill the remaining producer and watch the circuit breaker fallback behavior.
. Restart a producer and watch the consumer recover.
--

== Setup

. You can just reuse the Eureka server and the 2 producers from Lab 07a as shown below:

|=======
|Eureka     |http://localhost:8761
|Producer 1 |http://localhost:8080
|Producer 2 |http://localhost:8082 
|=======

In case you did not have time to complete the lab 07a, you can run all 3 application instances from lab 07a's `complete` folder.


. Ensure you have two instances of the producer service registered in Eureka (http://locahost:8761):

== Using Hystrix

NOTE: all the failover configuration is done on the `consumer` side (as opposed to the `producer` side. In case the `producer` fails, the `consumer` should know where to fall back to.


. Inside your IDE, go into the `springtrader-consumer` project.

. Open its `pom.xml` file and add the following dependency:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-hystrix</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. You now need to add the relevant configuration for your `Circuit Breaker`. We will rely on Spring Boot's default configuration.
+
Inside the class `io.springtrader.consumer.SpringtraderConsumerApplication`, add the annotation `@EnableCircuitBreaker`.


. Create the class `io.springtrader.consumer.ProducerClient` and into it paste the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
@Component
public class ProducerClient {

    @Autowired
    @LoadBalanced
    RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @HystrixCommand(fallbackMethod = "getProducerFallback")
    public ProducerResponse getValue() {
        return restTemplate.getForObject("http://producer", ProducerResponse.class);
    }

    public ProducerResponse getProducerFallback() {
        ProducerResponse response = new ProducerResponse();
        response.setValue(-1);
        response.setServerPort(-1);
        return response;
    }
}
----

. Refactor the class `io.springtrader.consumer.ConsumerController` to autowire the `ProducerClient` instead of `RestTemplate`, and then use it to obtain the `ProducerResponse`:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
ProducerClient client;

@RequestMapping(value = "/", produces = "application/json")
String consume() {
    ProducerResponse response = client.getValue();
    return String.format("{\"value\":%d}", response.getValue());
}
----

. Inside `src/main/resources/application.yml` add the following:
+
----
producer.ribbon.ServerListRefreshInterval: 5000
----

. Start the application by launching `SpringtraderConsumerApplication`

In your logs, you should see that Hystrix has been loaded:
```
c.n.h.c.m.e.HystrixMetricsPoller         : Starting HystrixMetricsPoller
ration$HystrixMetricsPollerConfiguration : Starting poller
```


. Test the consumer application on http://localhost:8091 and show that it is still receiving values from the producers.
Also, watch the producers and observe that Ribbon is performing round robin load balancing across the two producers

== Failover

. Shut down one of the two producer processes.

. reload url, test the consumer application and show that it is still receiving values from one of the producers.
+
You may get the fallback value of `-1` a few times due to the lag in removing the failed instance from the Ribbon cache. Eventually it will converge to hitting the only remaining healthy instance.

== Fallback

. Shut down the remaining producer process.

. Reload url, test the consumer application and show that it is only emitting the fallback value of `42`.

== Recovery

. Restart one of the producer processes. Wait for it to register with Eureka.

. Reload url, test the consumer application and show that eventually recovers and starts hitting the new producer process. This can take several seconds as the Eureka and Ribbon caches repopulate.

== Next Steps

Do not shut anything down when you complete this lab. We will add one additional component in link:../../session_07/lab_07d/lab_07d_hystrix_dashboard.adoc[Lab 07d].
