= Lab 07a - Client-Side Load Balancing with Ribbon

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes
[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
We'll again use Spring Cloud Netflix to implement client-side load balancing with Ribbon.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Change the consumer application from link:../../session_06/lab_06b/lab_06b_discovery.adoc[Lab 06b] to:
.. Use a `LoadBalancerClient`
.. Use a `RestTemplate` configured to resolve service names from Ribbon
. Test the new consumer versions against our local pool of producers
. Try swapping out the Ribbon load balancing algorithm
--

NOTE: before starting this lab, you can stop all the applications you had started in the previous labs. You will not need them anymore.

This lab uses 4 running applications. Here is a table that you can refer to during the lab.

|=======
|Eureka |http://localhost:8761
|Producer 1 |http://localhost:8080
|Producer 2 |http://localhost:8082 
|Consumer|http://localhost:8091
|=======



== Setup

. Four projects have been placed inside `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07a/initial/`. Import all of them inside your IDE of choice.

. Eureka: Open `springtrader-eureka` and launch the class `SpringtraderEurekaApplication`

. Connect to http://localhost:8761/ to confirm that Eureka has been started successfully. 

. A completed `springtrader-producer` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07a/initial/springtrader-producer` for your convenience.
Change to that directory and build
+
----
cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_07/lab_07a/initial/springtrader-producer
mvn clean package
----

. Now run the producer twice (on different ports), each in a different terminal/command window:
+
----
Linux, MacOS:
$ SERVER_PORT=8080 java -jar target/lab_07a-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
$ SERVER_PORT=8082 java -Deureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId=p8082 -jar target/lab_07a-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Windows:
> set SERVER_PORT=8080
> java -jar target/lab_07a-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
> set SERVER_PORT=8082
> java -Deureka.instance.metadataMap.instanceId=p8082 -jar target/lab_07a-springtrader-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Ensure you have two instances of the producer service registered in Eureka on http://localhost:8761 :

== Using the `LoadBalancerClient`

. Inside your IDE, open the project `springtrader-consumer`

. Where is Ribbon?
+
You might be interested to know how your Ribbon Client has been included inside your project so it can be used by our Consumer. Inside your `pom.xml` file, you will find the following dependency:

+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-eureka</artifactId>
</dependency> 
----

The `spring-cloud-starter-eureka` dependency transitively comes with the `Ribbon` libraries (you will find them in your list of `jar` files).


. In `io.springtrader.consumer.ConsumerController`, include the `consume()` method as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping(value="/", produces="application/json")
    public String consume() {
                
        ProducerResponse response = restTemplate.getForObject("http://producer", ProducerResponse.class);
        return String.format("{\"server port\":%d, \"value\":%d}", response.getServerPort(), response.getValue());
        
    }
----

. Run your application by launching `SpringtraderConsumerApplication`. 

. Connect to http://localhost:8091/ and access the consumer application several times. Per the round-robin algorithm, 50% if the requests should be served by producer 8080 (and the other half should go to producer 8082).

+
[source,json]
----
{
   "server port":8082,
   "value":4
}
----

== Failing one of the producers

You now have a Load Balancer that works across 2 Producers. But what happens when one of the Producers fails? 

. Stop one of the producers and try to access the consumer a few times. What can you notice?

. In the next lab, you will learn how to use a `circuit breaker` so failures can be handled gracefully.
