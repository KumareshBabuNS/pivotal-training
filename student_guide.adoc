== Student Guide

=== Schedule

The lectures for this class are intentionally very light and are only intended to set the stage for the hands-on labs.
The overwhelming majority of our time will be spent writing code directly!

Approximate session times are as follows.  Lab times vary by group and may be different for your course.

9:00 AM - 10:30 AM:: *Session 1:* _Spring Boot_
10:30 AM - 10:45 AM:: Morning Break
10:45 AM - 12:30 PM:: *Session 2:* _Cloud Foundry_
12:30 PM - 01:30 PM:: Lunch
01:30 PM - 03:00 PM:: *Session 6:* _Spring Cloud: Part 1 (Config Server and Eureka)_
03:00 PM - 03:15 PM:: Afternon Break
03:15 PM - 05:00 PM:: *Session 7:* _Spring Cloud: Part 2 (Ribbon and Hystrix)_

=== Important Note on the Labs

Much of this course involves using command line tools rather than GUI
applications.  This may be unfamiliar to some of you.

In particular, Windows users will need to open and use Command windows. To do this
press `WK` + `R` and type `cmd` (where WK is the Windows Key).

To keep the labs simple, although we encourage you to use an IDE, we only use it
for creating and editing files.  In most cases we build using `mvn` directly.
We accept that this is not typical but it makes the lab instructions simpler.
